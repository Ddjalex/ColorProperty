ðŸš¨ FIX: "Detected configuration files" Error

PROBLEM: cPanel can't find package.json file

SOLUTION:

1. UPLOAD THESE FILES to your public_html directory:
   âœ… package.json (from this folder)
   âœ… app.js (from this folder) 
   âœ… All your existing files (index.html, assets/, etc.)

2. CPANEL NODE.JS SETUP:
   - Application root: /home/temerrua/public_html
   - Application startup file: app.js
   - Node.js version: 18.x or higher

3. AFTER UPLOAD:
   - Refresh the Node.js setup page
   - You should now see "Run NPM Install" button clickable
   - Click "Run NPM Install"
   - Then click "Restart"

4. VISIT YOUR WEBSITE:

This package.json is specifically designed for cPanel hosting and will make the "Detected configuration files" work properly.
