ðŸš¨ PACKAGE.JSON STILL NOT DETECTED - TROUBLESHOOTING

CURRENT ISSUE: cPanel shows "package.json file is required"

STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

1. VERIFY FILE LOCATION:
   - Go to cPanel File Manager
   - Navigate to: /home/temerrua/public_html
   - Check if package.json exists in this EXACT directory
   - If missing, upload the package.json from this folder

2. CHECK APPLICATION ROOT:
   - In Node.js setup, verify "Application root" shows:
     /home/temerrua/public_html
   - If different, change it to match your file location

3. REFRESH NODE.JS INTERFACE:
   - Close Node.js setup page
   - Go back to main cPanel
   - Open Node.js again
   - Should now detect package.json

4. ALTERNATIVE FIX:
   - Delete the current Node.js application
   - Create a new Node.js application
   - Set Application root: /home/temerrua/public_html
   - Set Startup file: app.js

5. VERIFY WORKING:
   - "Run NPM Install" button should be clickable
   - No more warning about package.json

The package.json file MUST be in the same directory as your app.js file for cPanel to detect it properly.
