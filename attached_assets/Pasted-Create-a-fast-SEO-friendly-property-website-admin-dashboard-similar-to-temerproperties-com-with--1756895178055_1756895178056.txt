Create a fast, SEO-friendly property website + admin dashboard similar to temerproperties.com, with a hero slider, property cards (with Call and WhatsApp buttons), advanced filtering, map/list views, blog, team pages, and a persistent MongoDB Atlas database (no data loss on rebuild/deploy).

Tech & Structure

Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS. Use Server Components for SEO where helpful.

Backend: Next.js API routes (or Express server in the same repo), TypeScript, JWT sessions (httpOnly cookies).

DB: MongoDB Atlas (cluster + database + collections). Never seed on every boot; only on npm run seed when explicitly called.

Media: Upload images to Cloudinary (env keys). Store secure URLs in Mongo.

Map: Leaflet or Mapbox for Half-Map properties page.

Timezone & Locale: Africa/Addis_Ababa, currency ETB, areas in m².
