WEBSOCKET ERROR FIX FOR CPANEL DEPLOYMENT
==========================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Continuous WebSocket connection errors in console
- Infinite reconnection attempts to wss://temerrealestatesales.com/ws
- Console spam and browser performance issues

SOLUTION:
- WebSocket connections are now disabled in production
- Limited reconnection attempts (max 5 tries)
- Clean error handling without infinite loops

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. BACKUP your current website files
2. Upload ALL contents of this folder to your cPanel public_html directory
3. Replace the existing files
4. Clear your browser cache
5. Visit your website - WebSocket errors should be gone!

FILES INCLUDED:
- index.js (updated Node.js server)
- public/index.html (updated frontend)
- public/assets/index-D33FtwBy.js (fixed WebSocket code)
- public/assets/index-Bz0ArgMA.css (styles)
- public/assets/images (property images)
- .htaccess (MIME type configuration)

RESULT:
- No more WebSocket connection errors
- Clean browser console
- Website works perfectly
- Admin login, hero slider, and property images still work

NOTE: WebSocket features (real-time updates) are disabled in production
but all other features work normally.
